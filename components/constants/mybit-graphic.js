      The MyBit Network is powered by the MyBit Token (MYB).
      MYB is used for everything from executing specific functions with our SDKs
      to accessing features of applications. Basically, all apps built on MyBit
      (including MyBitGO) use MYB to function. MYB acts as the fuel for
      the network and is used to execute functions within the MyBit SDK and to
      access features of applications.
